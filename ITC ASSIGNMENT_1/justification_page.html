         <p> Here, i'll talk about my justification for why i created only one file for all html file.
                  I want all my pages and its background to be uniform that's why I created only one css file. Having uniform background, uniform 
                  font, uniform font-size looks simple yet elegent. That's what i want to do here.
         </p>

         <p> Here are the reasons why I created a single css file for all html files:</p>

         <ul>
            <Li><b>Consistency in Design :</b> Ensures a uniform look across all subjects and the bio page, reflecting professionalism.</Li>

            <Li>    <b>Ease of Maintenance:</b> Simplifies updates and adjustments by centralizing styles in one file, that is easy to maintain.</Li>

            <Li><b> Simplified Development Process:</b> Streamlines setup by avoiding multiple stylesheets, minimizing potential errors.</Li>

            <Li><b>Modesty with Elegent Design:</b> Organizes styles by subject, allowing easy additions or modifications without disruption.</Li>


        </ul>
